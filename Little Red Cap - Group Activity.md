**Stanza 1 *Symbolism***

Each of the phrases in the grid below has a symbolic or metaphorical meaning. Note your ideas in the spaces below:

|  *Childhood’s end* | “”The author mentioned that she was underage, but was forced to an early adulthood, symbolizing that she has to bear a greater responsibility to preserve her newfound relationship with the wolf without any proper experience. |
| :---- | :---- |
|  *Playing Fields* | Playing in the fields is a very stereotypical childhood activity for people from more rural areas. This activity connotes the innocence of the child, worry free and ignorant of worldly evils. This activity symbolizes the innocence the poet possesses at the beginning of the poem. Furthermore, the fact that the ‘houses’ ‘petered into’ (diminished into) the ‘playing fields’ such as a sense of expansion in scale, from a ‘house’ to a ‘field’. The increase in scale invokes a sense of freedom, where the ‘house’ symbolizes the protective restrictions from the parents while the field symbolizes the freedom granted via the age of consent, while also coming with the exposure to dangers. |
| *Factory* | Symbolizes adult responsibilities? The dull, repetitive responsibilities of work in society? |
|  *Allotments kept like mistresses*   | Allotments are defined as a rented plot of land meant for growing vegetables or flowers, but are reinterpreted as mistresses, possibly symbolizing to show that they are the property of ‘kneeling married men’. Mistresses can have the access to resources at the cost of their freedom being ‘kept’. |
|  *Silent railway line*   | Given that this railway is ‘to the woods’, it could symbolize the path to forbidden love (literal 10 year age gap) like the one the poet took part in. The fact that it is ‘silent’ could suggest that most people understand this is a bad idea, therefore not many people travel towards ‘the woods’, hence silent. The railway line could symbolize the path to unhealthy relationships, reflecting how the poet is lamenting her young, ignorant behaviour in hindsight. |
|  *Hermit’s caravan*   | ‘Hermit’ is someone who is in isolation, and attempts to avoid all social interactions. ‘Caravan’ is a small truck-like vehicle someone can live in. Hermit’s caravan could symbolize how during the relationship with Henry, the poet is ‘isolated’, like a Hermit, with Henry. The ‘Hermit’ is not Henry, it is herself. (since Henry had many affairs with others) Hermit’s caravan symbolizes her ignorance and how her love was exclusively to him (their relationship symbolized by the caravan), but not the other way around.  |

| Wolf Words | Connotations | Narrator | Connotations |

|   |   | *Sweet sixteen*   |  Sixteen is typically the legal age of consent, and also in some areas, the phrase “Sweet sixteen” can be seen as the age for a person to go on dates. |
|   |   |  *Never been*   |   |
|   |   |  *Babe*   |  Could link to how she is innocent and still a virgin, especially after saying never been. |
|   |   |  *Waif*   |  “Waif” Means neglected or not given attention so she is seeking for attention (possibly sexual, possibly just love).  |
|   |   |       |   |

**Stanza 4 *Non-lexical Features***

 Find examples of all the following non-lexical features and comment on their effect in this stanza:

|  Non-lexical feature   |  Example |  Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  Enjambment   |  “I clung till dawn to his thrashing fur, for what little girl doesn’t dearly love a wolf?” |  The enjambment creates a flow between the lines, a reflection of the protagonists’ immersion in the wolf. The run-on structure builds a sense of intimacy. |
| Rhyme   |  “wolf’s lair, better beware.” |  The rhyme between “lair” and “beware” illustrates a playful, nursery rhyme quality into the stanza, emphasizing the fairy like origins of the poem, but it also highlights a tone of caution and foreboding. |
|  Interrogative / question   |  “what little girl doesn’t dearly love a wolf?” |  The rhetorical question here is utilized to prompt readers to question societal norms around female desire and innocence. Duffy creates a pause in the narrative, which reinforces the poem's feminist critique of how young women are pulled into predatory relationships. |
|  Punctuation for effect   |  “- white dove \-“ |  The dashes isolate “white dove” as an interjection, which creates a dramatic emphasis that disrupts the previous narrative rhythm. This could potentially highlight the shift in the wolves' character from a dark person into a pure person. |
|  Ceasura   | .  “It was there that I first clapped eyes on the wolf” “He stood in a clearing” |  Duffy uses the Ceasura to show the audience the difference in both age and them as people. This is shown repeatedly in the poem as well, by repeatedly adding enjambments to really highlight the difference between Duffy and Henri. Gurt: |

**Stanza 5 *Sound Patterns***

 Can you explain the use of metaphor in the following words and phrases? Can you then comment on the additional meanings and effects created by sound patterns?

 

|  *One bite, dead*   | This shows the death of childhood innocences.  |  The protagonist’s childhood was instantly destroyed the moment she partook in the seductive but dangerous adult world from the wolf, also known as Adrian Henri. |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  *How nice, breakfast in bed, he said*   |  Shows the luxury of being with the wolf. |  “Breakfast in bed” shows the luxury of being with ‘the wolf’. The wolf is framing a romantic and cozy scene towards the protagonist making her believe she’s with the right person. |
|  *A whole wall was crimson, gold, aglow with books*   |  Shows the intellect of the wolf, also known as Adrian Henri |  The wall of books is a symbol of everything the wolf represents, it represents his power, intellect, and seductive charm. |
|  *Words were truly alive on the tongue*   |  Shows the romance between the wolf and the main protagonist. |  Represents the romance the wolf and the protagonist have during the poem, Symbolizes them kissing. |
|  *Warm, beating, frantic, winged*   | Uses the asyndetic listing of the verbs to show the reader the fast pace of their relationship.  |  Typically, this sentence would be read relatively fast, which is solidified by the addition of “frantic”. |
|  *Music and blood*     |  Represents polar opposite concepts. ‘Music’ represents art and love. ‘Blood’ representing the violence within the wolf. | ‘Music’ represents the wolf’s art, his poetry, his language, and his seductive power. ‘Blood’ represents the primal, violent, and dangerous reality beneath the surface. |

 

**Stanza 6 *Interpretation***

 What has the narrator learned after ‘ten years in the woods’? In your own words, write your understanding of the ideas in this stanza: She has learned that she has let go of herself the young happy version of herself she also notices the repetitive nature of the wolf and how he hasn’t changed by using sibilance which is the repetition of the S sound, which can sound very drawling and long.

 **Stanza 7 *Images and Allusions***

 What is the significance of the following allusions (to the original fairy tale) and images?

 

|  *I took an axe to the wolf as he slept* |  Reference to the hunter in the original fairy tale, who saves the grandmother and little red cap, could be reference to her saving herself from her unfaithful and controlling partner. |
| :---- | :---- |
|  *One chop, scrotum to throat* |  Once again a reference to the original story where the hunter slices the wolf open. The author deliberately chooses those human body parts as it could be a reference to sexual activities and highlights the abuse she had to go through.  |
| *The glistening virgin white of my grandmother’s bones* |  This creates stark contrast from the happy ending from the Grimm’s version (the widely known, “classic version”). The repelling image invokes a sense of grimness and depressing atmosphere; this image reflects how in reality there is no ‘hunter’ as a saviour, and someone eaten by the wolf will not miraculously survive. Through this image, the poet conveys how love in fairy tales is much different compared to ones in real life. The death of the grandmother reflects the death of the traditional (old) fairy tale believes the poet holds for love or some something like that this is all bs |
| *I filled his old belly with stones* |  Reference to original story where wolf belly was filled with stones. This could be a hint towards Duffy finally leaving him and allowing him to stay satisfied with the other women he had affairs with. |
| *I stitched him up* |  The image created by stitching him up tells us that there will be a scar afterwards. This could show the readers that little red cap is leaving him with a painful reminder even though it may be metaphorical. |
|  *Out of the forest I come with my flowers, singing, all alone.*  |  This last line creates the image of how little red cap is incredibly resilient because she is able to come out of an abusive relationship and still have the will to sing. (also has literary allusion to the original story (flowers) |
