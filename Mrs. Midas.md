light heart tone; juxtaposition with the tragic depressing language later on

historical reference;

intertextual reference to the narnia series; she was a housekeeper who valued possessions over people;  
the fact that she thought of her when she see's Mr. Midas' actions literally reflects Midas' state and greed during that moment.

"name of God"
invoking a religious phrase here is more than just a common response to express suprise, but also could relate to a biblical allusion where "it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of an needle than a rich man to enter the gates of heaven", foreshadowing the tragic fate to come for Mr. Midas for his actions of greed

metaphoric:  
he first tampered with his own objects, then hers; reflects how he first limited himself to his own, easy to replace objects, but it moved on to affect her; how his actions affect more than just him; selfish/intertext to original story?

"I poured with a shaking hand"

besides being a type of wine, bone-dry could also mean lack of substance; (clearly no flesh) suggesting how wealth is useless if you cant spend it

turning point

"He sank to his knees"
he is burned by turning the wine into gold; the kneeing is the turning point in the story where his dominance in the family plummets; symbolizes the servitude/dependence on his wife from now on by kneeing; juxtaposes with traditional gender roles in the original myth where his daughter was presented as the victim

"I finished the wine on my own"
the wine could symbolize the who holds the power; previously, she poured the wine. Now, she is drinking the wine, suggesting that she now has a position of power or is at least focusing on herself

"Look, we all have wishes; granted.  // But who has wishes granted? Him. Do you know about gold?"
not technically her action but rather an internal monologue that uses rhetorical questions to emphasize her confusion, stress and anxiety and anger over the situation which we presumed happened within a few hours from evening to dinner

"slakes  // no thirst"
enjambment + double entendre;  
of course, liquid gold will not help anyone with their thirst, but also this could metaphorically suggest how people will always seek more wealth; human greed is unsatifiable

his hands, his warm hands on my skin, his touch.
poet conveying how happiness/love > wealth

1. How would you characterize the speaker's voice? Is it formal, colloquial, emotional, ironic? Find specific words or phrases that establish her tone in the first few stanzas.

The speaker, Mrs. Midas, talks in a casual, emotional tone. This is evident through phrases such as “I’d” which establishes a casual, conversational nature of the monologue. Furthermore, prior to her fearing for her life, her tone was rather amusing when reacting to him turning pears into gold evident through the phrase: ‘is he putting fairy lights in the tree?’. This implies that her marriage with Mr. Midas prior to this event is loving and intimate, which serves as strong contrast to their relationship later in the story, suggesting how Duffy could be conveying the devastating effects of excessive avarice on people’s relationships.



2. The poem is a dramatic monologue. How does Duffy's choice to tell the story from Mrs. Midas's perspective, rather than a third-person narrator, immediately change our relationship to the myth?

- Monologue assumes inner thoughts of the speaker
    
- The original myth was written in third person, narrating over the life of King Midas
    
- By using a monologue, the story becomes more intimate and focuses on the feelings of a specific character rather than the story as a whole. It feels more lively and personal, aided by the use of a conversational tone.
    
- The use of monologues brings us into the shoes of the female character within the story, while the original story focuses on the effects of King Midas. The original myth brings out a moral story of how greed can harm ourselves, while this poem uses more of a side character who was brought into the situation unwillingly and how one’s actions can harm others.



The title immediately signals a shift in focus. What does the move from "Midas" to "Mrs. Midas" tell us about Duffy's project? 
  
“Mrs. Midas” is a fictional character invented by Carol Ann Duffy within the poem of the same name. Disregarding the contents, the title by itself switches the perspective from the traditional male focused myth evident through the male possessive adjective “The Midas Touch” to the proper noun “Mrs. Midas”. This shift signals how Duffy’s project is attempting to provide a voice to women by switching the focus of myths.

Throughout the poem, the grand, mythical "gift" is brought into a mundane, domestic setting. Find three examples where the magical event is described using ordinary, household language or imagery (e.g., "He sat in that chair like a king on a burnished throne"). What is the effect of this contrast?  
  
“we grew Fondante d’Automne – // and it sat in his palm, like a lightbulb.”  
Fondante d’ Automne is a breed of pear praised for its delicacy. It is extremely rare and grown in france under strict conditions. This sweet and nourishing fruit is being compared to a lightbulb — a lifeless object used purely to illuminate a room and most likely neglected until it stops working. The contrast could reflect the stages of their relationship before and after the event, where prior to the event, their relationship was sweet and intimate evident through the relaxed tone in the first few stanzas, which strongly juxtaposes with the separation and lack of familial/household imagery later on.


“corn on the cob. … Within seconds he was spitting out the teeth of the rich.”  
Corn is a very common food that is widely consumed due to its ease of growth, large production count and provides sufficient ease to consume calories. Corn on the cob is simplistic while providing sufficient nutrition — a common household dish. However, when biting into the corn
